# Hey, I'm Ilan 👋

AI-native product leader. I build fast, learn faster, and ship things that matter.

## What I'm working on

🎓 **[Teachr.me](https://teachr.me)** — Edtech product using agentic AI to cut teacher grading time by 70%. Built with Claude + ChatGPT.

🎙️ **[Prompt and Circumstance](https://www.pandcpodcast.com)** — Co-hosting a weekly podcast on AI-native product development, aiming to teach product teams something useful every two weeks.

## How I build

I'm a product leader who writes code - I build prototypes, automate workflows, and aim to solve real problems for my teams and for the world at large.

- **Prototyping:** Lovable, Bolt, Cursor, v0
- **Automation:** n8n, Python, API integrations
- **LLMs:** Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistal, DeepSeek
- **Analysis:** SQL, Pendo, building internal tools

## My philosophy

Ship → Learn → Iterate. Most product work fails because teams over-plan and under-ship. I'd rather build something ugly that teaches us something than spec something perfect that never launches.

## Background

Director of Product at a shipping/logistics company, where I grew a product line from $XXM → $XXXM. Before that: BI product management, mechanical engineering degrees (UofT, UBC).

I care about building for underserved users—small businesses, teachers, people the tech industry often ignores.
